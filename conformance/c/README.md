# C conformance runner

A non-Racket implementation of Permit Protocol v1 verification. It exercises
the portable vector corpus in [`test-vectors/v1/`](../../test-vectors/v1/) end
to end: exact-byte Ed25519 authentication, trust-store rules, closed claim
schemas, and the positive and negative policy cases. Passing this runner is
the cross-language evidence that the corpus, not one language's reading of
it, defines the protocol.

The runner is a single C11 source file with one dependency: OpenSSL 3.x
(`libcrypto`) for Ed25519 and SHA-256. It links no Racket code and shares no
logic with the reference implementation, which is the point — agreement can
only come from the vectors.

## Build and run

```bash
make
./permit-conformance ../../test-vectors/v1
```

The Makefile prefers Homebrew's `openssl@3` on macOS (the system crypto
library is LibreSSL and has no Ed25519), then falls back to `pkg-config`.
On Linux, install the OpenSSL development files (`libssl-dev` and
`pkg-config` on Debian-style distributions).

Windows builds are expected to work through a vcpkg `openssl` installation
and any C11 toolchain, but they are not yet exercised in CI; the C standard
library usage is deliberately portable so that remains a build-only task.

## What it checks

1. The byte-level manifest (`credential-vectors.json`): payload file
   lengths, SHA-256 digests, envelope payload bytes, signatures, and that
   every positive credential verifies against the default trust store.
2. The exact-byte signature guard: appending a single payload byte breaks
   verification.
3. Every case in `conformance.json`: verification outcomes, rejection
   classes (tampered payloads, unknown key ids, revoked keys, issuance
   windows, key purposes, duplicate JSON members, aliased trust keys), and
   policy decisions with exact failure reasons where the corpus fixes them.

The rejection paths mirror the reference verification order: envelope
structure, key lookup, signature, payload schema, issuer, issuance window,
key purpose. Policy windows are inclusive at both ends, and missing
evaluation context fails closed.

To confirm the runner is not vacuously green, any modification to a vector
file or an expected verdict in a corpus copy must produce failures and exit
status 1.

## Relationship to the Racket suite

`permit-test/vector-test.rkt` executes the same corpus through the Racket
reference implementation. The two harnesses must always agree; they are
independent readers of one contract. Update the corpus first, then both
implementations together, following [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).
