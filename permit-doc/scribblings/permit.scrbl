@title[#:tag "permit"]{Permit: Signed Product Rights}
@author[(author+email "Turing Lambda" "jirentianxiang1024@gmail.com")]

@defmodule[permit]

Permit is a framework-neutral protocol and Racket reference
implementation for answering one product question: what may this
person, organization, or installation use right now? Long-lived
@emph{entitlements} describe commercial rights, optional short-lived
@emph{activation leases} bind a right to an installation, and local
first-run @emph{trials} are their own convenience state. Everything is
verified offline against an Ed25519 trust store that ships inside the
application; issuance and rotation are online concerns that never
change the verification protocol.

Permit is deliberately not anti-tamper DRM, and a permanently offline
credential cannot learn about a revocation that happened elsewhere —
see @hyperlink["https://github.com/turinglambdaai/permit/blob/main/docs/threat-model.md"]{the
threat model} for the honest boundaries. The normative protocol lives in
@hyperlink["https://github.com/turinglambdaai/permit/blob/main/docs/protocol-v1.md"]{Protocol
v1}; this manual documents the Racket surface.

@section{Trust stores}

Applications ship public keys only. A trust store is JSON application
configuration, delivered through the application's authenticated
release path:

@codeblock|{
{
  "protocol": "permit-trust-store",
  "version": 1,
  "issuer": "com.example",
  "keys": {
    "license-2027": {
      "algorithm": "Ed25519",
      "public_key": "<Base64 SubjectPublicKeyInfo DER>",
      "status": "active",
      "purposes": ["entitlement", "trial", "trial-extension"],
      "not_before": "2027-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "not_after": null
    }
  }
}
}|

Key statuses are @tt{next} (pre-distributed, must have @tt{not_before}),
@tt{active} (normal issuance), @tt{retired} (no new issuance, must have
an @tt{not_after} issuance cutoff — old credentials stay authentic), and
@tt{revoked} (every credential under the key fails). Each key declares
the credential types it may sign; an activation-signing key therefore
cannot mint a perpetual entitlement. The time windows constrain the
credential's authenticated @tt{issued_at}, not the wall clock at
verification — retiring a key never kills a perpetual entitlement.

@defproc[(read-trust-store [source (or/c path-string? input-port?)])
         trust-store?]{
Parses and validates a trust store document. Unknown key statuses,
missing purposes, and wrong algorithms are rejected here.
}

@defproc[(jsexpr->trust-store [value jsexpr?]) trust-store?]{
The same validation for an already-parsed document.
}

@defproc[(trust-store? [v any/c]) boolean?]{}
@defproc[(trust-store-issuer [store trust-store?]) string?]{
The only credential issuer this store will accept.
}

@section{Verifying credentials}

A credential is a small JSON envelope whose @tt{payload} is base64
bytes signed exactly with Ed25519. Verification authenticates those
bytes first and only then parses authorization claims — the verifier
never re-serializes JSON, which removes canonicalization ambiguity
across languages.

@defproc[(verify-credential [source (or/c path-string? input-port?)]
                            [store trust-store?])
         verified-credential?]{
Verifies signature, trust key, issuer, key purpose, and key issuance
window, then parses and schema-checks the payload. Any refusal raises
@racket[exn:fail:permit:verify] — an invalid credential is an error, not a
boolean — with a @racket[reason] naming the guard; see
@secref["verification-failures"].
}

@defproc[(verified-credential? [v any/c]) boolean?]{
Only values returned by @racket[verify-credential] satisfy this
predicate; the constructor is sealed so unverified claims cannot flow
into policy checks.
}

The claims accessors (all @racket[(-> verified-credential? ...)]):
@defproc[(verified-credential-type [c verified-credential?]) string?]{
@tt{"entitlement"}, @tt{"trial"}, @tt{"trial-extension"}, or
@tt{"activation"}.
}
@defproc[(verified-credential-id [c verified-credential?]) string?]{}
@defproc[(verified-credential-issuer [c verified-credential?]) string?]{}

@defproc[(verified-credential-subject-display [c verified-credential?]) (or/c string? #f)]{

@defproc[(verified-credential-use-expires-at [c verified-credential?]) (or/c string? #f)]{

@subsection[#:tag "verification-failures"]{Verification failures}

A refusal is always an exception — fail-closed never returns a value — and
carries a reason so a product can tell the customer what was wrong with a
license file without matching message text. Time outcomes (expiry,
not-yet-valid, installation mismatch, missing activation) are not refusals;
they come back from @racket[credential-status] as status reasons. See
@hyperlink["https://github.com/turinglambdaai/permit/blob/main/docs/decisions/0002-typed-verification-failures.md"]{decision
0002}.

@defstruct*[(exn:fail:permit exn:fail) ([reason symbol?])]{
The parent of every Permit refusal, on the verifier and the issuer side.
@racket[exn:fail:permit-reason] is the one accessor for both.
}

@defstruct*[(exn:fail:permit:verify exn:fail:permit) ()]{
Raised by @racket[verify-credential]. Its @racket[reason] is one of
@racket[verify-failure-reasons]. Messages keep the
@racket[raise-arguments-error] layout, so callers that matched message text
keep working. A store that is not a @racket[trust-store?] is a plain
contract error, not a refusal.
}

@defthing[verify-failure-reasons (listof symbol?)]{
@racket['(envelope key-unknown key-revoked signature schema issuer key-window key-purpose)]
in pipeline order — the wrapper could not be read or is not a Protocol v1
envelope; the @tt{key_id} is not in the store; the key is revoked; the
Ed25519 signature does not verify; the authenticated payload failed strict
parsing or schema validation; the signed @tt{issuer} differs from the
store's; @tt{issued_at} falls outside the key's issuance window; the key's
purposes do not include the credential type. Because the order is the
order a conforming verifier checks in, the reason also tells you which
guard refused.
}

@section{Evaluating policy}

Policy evaluation is total and offline: every check takes the verified
credential, an evaluation instant (@racket[(current-rfc3339)] by
default), and optional binding parameters.

@section{Issuing credentials}

@defmodule[permit/issuer]

The issuer surface is an explicit opt-in; the client facade above
never exports private-key operations.

The safe issuance path: schema-validates the payload, pins issuer,
active key status, key purpose, and the key's issuance window, and

@racket[raco permit sign] is the deliberate low-level escape hatch.

supported programmatic path from safe issuance to storage or delivery.
}

@subsection{Rights snapshots}

An issuer builds a complete rights snapshot, serializes it once, and hands
those bytes to @racket[issue-credential]. These constructors spell the closed
entitlement schema so that adapters never do; every field is an explicit
keyword with a @racket['null] or empty default wherever the schema allows
one. See
@hyperlink["https://github.com/turinglambdaai/permit/blob/main/docs/decisions/0001-issuer-rights-snapshots.md"]{decision
0001} for the boundary this layer defines.

A credential subject. @racket[type] is one of @racket["person"],
